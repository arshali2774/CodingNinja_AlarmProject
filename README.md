Alarm Clock Project to implement the setTimeout and setInterval functions

## Objective
---
- My objective was to first create a working clock then move on to setting the alarm clock
- To setup the clock was easy, just get the current time and update the time every second.
- For the alarm part i used the default HTML input elements and buttons.
- Then populate the alarm list.

## Hurdles
---
- First hurdle was to setup the alarm that works.
- Firstly I only created one alarm to test it out, when it works i know i have to use an array.
- The major hurdle was when i was able to create multiple alarms after the first alarm was over then its interval was not cleared and was used by the second alarm.
- This created a bug, when first alarm went off then after every sec there was a pop-up that the alarm is over and when i clicked ok then it appears again.
- Therefore i know i have clear the interval also and each alarm should have different intervals.

## Conclusion
---
- From the starting i know that the code will be heavily relying on setTimeout and setInterval functions and i understand the problem well.
- After making a mind map i solve the problem by solving multiple small problems
- Happy to say i took as least possible help needed.
